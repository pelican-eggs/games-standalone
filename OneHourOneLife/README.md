# OneHourOneLife

[One Hour One Life](https://onehouronelife.com/) is a multiplayer survival game of parenting and civilization building by Jason Rohrer.

## Documentation

This is open source; more details about the server and adjustable settings can be found in the [github repo](https://github.com/jasonrohrer/OneLife/tree/master/server/installYourOwnServer).

## Install notes

First install will take a while because the games source code and assets will be downloaded and the games executable will have to be compiled.

## Installation/System Requirements
|  | Bare Minimum | Recommended |
|---------|---------|---------|
| RAM | 2GiB | 2GiB |
| Storage | 1GiB | 1GiB |

## Variables
* Port: Required to connect to the game server
* Server Name: Customise the server name

* Require Password: Enable password protection for the server

### Notes

As this is my first egg, I haven't yet worked out how to make it check for version updates, etc. Any help would be appreciated.

At the very least, if reinstalling for a version update, back up your server first so you can restore files.
