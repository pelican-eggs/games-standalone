# [Hytale](https://hytale.com/) 

Set out on an adventure built for both creation and play. Hytale blends the freedom of a sandbox with the momentum of an RPG: explore a procedurally generated world full of dungeons, secrets, and a variety of creatures, then shape it block by block.

Our Early Access release focuses on polished core systems - exploration, responsive combat, and robust building - alongside creator‑first tools for making your own content, crafting minigames, and running community servers.

Jump in, make your mark, and help us grow this world together!
