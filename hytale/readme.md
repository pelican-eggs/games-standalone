# hytale
this is the install script i wrote to install hytale servers through pelican it will automate everything except for the authorization through the hytale-downloader you will need to that manually until we get other sources to download the server from

you cannot set the port as the server does not support it yet ram usage is limited by settings a limit by pelican

this egg should be importable as is and start working right away

| Port    | default |
|---------|---------|
| Game    | 5520    |
